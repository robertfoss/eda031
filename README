Usenet News is an old (started in 1979) system for sharing information over the net. News is
distributed in the form of “articles” that are posted to “newsgroups”. Articles are distributed to
news servers, and a user can hook up to a news server and read articles, and also post articles in
newsgroups and create new newsgroups. The user runs a news client which uses the NNTP1
protocol to communicate with the server.
In this project, you shall develop your own news system, consisting of a news server and
a news client. Both programs shall be written in C++. The server is dedicated and does not
share news with other servers. Instead of NNTP, you will use the communication protocol that is
defined in section 6.
